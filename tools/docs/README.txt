LPub3D 1.3 XXXX
 
Features and enhancements 
------------ 
-Dialog to print or export to image all pages, current page and custom range of pages (e.g. 1,3,5,7-9)
-Add ability to configure additional ldraw content directories using ldrawini c api
 I implemented the ldrawini c api to maintain compatability with LPub3D 3rd Party renderers - LDView, L3P(PovRay) and Ldglite. Additional directories must have same tree as LDraw Unofficial directory (i.e. parts and/or p subdirectories...) or alternatively, content can be deposited at the root of the additional directory (i.e. C:/ldrawFiles/*.dat). Directories declared in the ldraw.ini file at the root (C:/ldrawFiles), primitive (.../p) or parts (.../parts) will be properly managed in LPub3D. Other declarations have not been addressed in the process logic and may yield unintended behavior.
-Add Rotate Icon - indicate that the builder should "flip" the model
-Add line type attribute to border configuration
 This adds a new meta value after (NONE|ROUND|SQUARE). Valid values are 
 0=none,1=solid,2=dash,3=dot,4=dashDot,5=dashDotDot. So an old meta line like this:
 0 !LPUB PLI BORDER GLOBAL ROUND Black 0 15 MARGINS 0.472439 0.07 should be updated to this:
 0 !LPUB PLI BORDER GLOBAL ROUND 1 Black 0 15 MARGINS 0.472439 0.07
-Add PLI/BOM part substitution - substitute modeled part in PLI/BOM with alternate
 This feature is useful when you have a modeled part (e.g. Power Functions Light) that will
 take alot of space in the BOM/PLI, you can substitute the modeled version with an alternate 
 representation that is suitable for the PLI/BOM view. This feature is complementary to LDCad's
 template functionality which allows you to model adjustable parts as needed. To use this 
 functionality, simply edit the substituation list from Configuration=>Edit BOM/PLI Substitute Parts List
-Add LDCad UNOFFICIAL PART meta to recognize LDCad template generated parts
-Add gradients to background options
-Add Change local page background - colour, gradient, picture, submodel, none
-Update 3DViewer to LeoCAD build 1867
-[not implemented]Generate warning message when LPub 0 !LPUB INSERT COVER_PAGE encountered. Message: 
 LPub3D does not support the LPub meta 0 !LPUB INSERT COVER_PAGE.
 Please update to 0 !LPUB INSERT COVER_PAGE FRONT (or BACK) accordingly.
-Remove PartsList class, use instead lcPiecesLibrary class to verify parts and capture part title
-[not completed]Remove final model if fadestep not enabled KO
-Move process fade colour parts separate thread
-Move fade parts directory from under LDraw/Unofficial/parts and LDraw/Unofficial/p to as single directory
 under LDraw/Unofficial. So from this version of LPub3D, the fade directory will be autogenerated and populated
 as LDraw/Unofficial/fade. Old fade directories under Unofficial/parts and p must be manually removed if desired.
-Redesign color part list and archive classes - rename and separate generage color parts list
-Cosmetic updates
-Fix: Changing step number attributes on multi-step pages are now working
-Fix: PLI/BOM sort routine, sort on 'part colour' part(s) appear out of place relative to
 part size and colour.
-Fix: Do not create instruction page(s) for unofficial part
-CHANGE: BOM default sort to sort by colour then size, previous default was size only (PLI default sort by size)
-CHANGE: Change 'Update' tab in preferences dialog to 'Other'.

LPub3D 1.2.3.443.2

LPub3D 1.2.1.437.2 
 
Features and enhancements 
------------ 
-Fix: PLI/BOM sort routine, sort on 'part colour' part(s) appear out of place relative to

-CHANGE: BOM default sort to sort by colour then size, previous default was size only (PLI default sort by size) 
 
LPub3D 1.2.0.388.4 
 
Features and enhancements 
------------ 
-Sort PLI/BOM by part size (default), colour and category 
-Improved model navigation - display selected model from model drop-down. Ignored 'meta=IGN' 
 submodels are not displayed even though they are in the drop-down list because they are 
 not assigned a page number. 
-Display LDraw colour code on BOM/PLI tooltip - now showing colour description, colour code and 
 part description. 
-Go To Page navigation combo box - allow page navigation using drop-down box. 
-Show progress bar during display page processing. 
-Text entries can now accomodate quotes using escape character '\' - e.g. This \"Fat\" MOC 
 will display: This "Fat" MOC. Edits must always include the '\' escape character. 
-Fix: When changing the font on added text, the dialog starts with MS Shell Dlg 2 size 12. 
 The dialog now starts with display of the actual font perameters being changed. 
-Fix: Change to PLI Times Used attribue on multi-step page now affects only the selected step. 
 when use local option selected. 
-Fix: Change to PLI Text Annotation attribue on multi-step page now affects only the selected step. 
 when use local option selected. 
-Fix: Change to PLI Background attribue on multi-step page now affects only the selected step. 
 when use local option selected. 
-Fix: Change to PLI Border attribue on multi-step page now affects only the selected step. 
 when use local option selected. 
-Fix: Change to Step number attribue on multi-step page now affects only the selected step. PARTIAL - Use 
 local selection still not working. 
 
-CHANGE: Move PLI annotations settings from application preferences to BOM/PLI Setup preferences. 
-CHANGE: LPub3D distribution no longer packed due to reported Win32 incompatability issues. 
 unpacked executable and dependencies are now deposited in installation folder 
 for both x32 and x64 distributions.

LPub3D 1.1.0.370.2 
 
Features and enhancements 
------------ 
-Enable/disable PLI annotations (Preference Dialog) 
-Edit part title annotations 
-Fix: source URL on about dialog 
-Fix: .dat subFiles not processed for 3D viewer - causes abnormal end (expected 
 dat files to be treated as part and placed in Official/unofficial parts). 
 Dat subfiles are now treated same as mpd/ldr subfiles. 
 
-CHANGE: isSubmodel check no longer observes meta !LDRAW_ORG as Submodel=False 
 
-KNOWN ISSUE: When an image (e.g. logo) is placed bottom left or bottom right 
 right of the page header, dragging the image produces unexpected placement - the same 
 may be true with regards to placement relative to the page footer. 
 WORKAROUND: If you want to reposition by dragging, set the image relative to the Page 
 (any relative position) or bottom center of the header/ top center of the footer.
