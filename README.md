#LPub3D

LDraw™ editor for LEGO® style digital building instructions.

**LPub3D** is an Open Source WYSIWYG editing application for creating LEGO® style digital building instructions. 
LPub3D is developed and maintained by Trevor SANDY. It uses the LDraw parts library, the most comprehensive 
library of digital Open Source LEGO® bricks available (www.ldraw.org/ ) and reads the LDraw LDR and MPD model file formats. 

Portions of LPub3D are based on LPUB© 2007-2009 Kevin Clague, LeoCAD© 2015 Leonardo Zide and additional third party components.
